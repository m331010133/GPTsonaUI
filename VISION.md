**GPTsonaUI – Vision Document**
1. Core Idea

GPTsonaUI transforms static chat AI interfaces into fully personalized, character-driven experiences.
Where most AI UIs look sterile and uniform, GPTsonaUI gives users the ability to create unique per-chat (url) identities through customizable avatars, backgrounds, themes, and names — similar to the feeling of Character.AI sites, but with the intelligence, memory, and adaptability of modern LLMs.

This bridges the gap between raw intelligence (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) and emotional immersion (Character.AI sites), without sacrificing usability or integrity.

2. Features (Current State)

Per-Chat Customization: Each chat can have its own background, theme, and “character identity.”

Custom Avatars: Upload user/assistant avatars (supports static images and animated GIFs).

Custom Names: Rename the AI and yourself per chat.

Dynamic Backgrounds: Upload backgrounds (supports GIFs), with adjustable opacity and blur.

Persistence: Settings are stored locally per chat, surviving reloads and reboots.

Lightweight & Local: No servers, no cloud dependency. Powered purely by local Chrome storage.

3. Known Limitations (for future devs)

Background sometimes requires a manual reload to update.

Assistant “typing dot” may overlap with custom name occasionally.

Limited to Chrome extensions for now.

4. Future Development Roadmap
Phase 1 – Extension Maturity

Improve background handling (instant reload-free updates).

Smooth out UI polish: typing indicators, avatar alignment, responsive scaling.

Multi-theme support per chat: switch instantly between custom themes.

Phase 2 – Multi-Platform Expansion

Apply GPTsonaUI to other LLMs (DeepSeek, Grok, Gemini).

Ensure extension modularity so adding new platforms is plug-and-play.

Phase 3 – Advanced Features

Voice Customization: AI voice with user-selected or generated tones (local first, cloud optional).

Interactive Animations: Dynamic reactions for avatars (blink, idle animations, etc.).

Advanced Per-Chat Profiles: Save/load “character profiles” with pre-set styles + prompt settings.

Phase 4 – Ecosystem Growth

Desktop App Layer: Windows/macOS wrapper that skins AI chats with GPTsonaUI themes (like Vencord for Discord).

Mobile Integrations: Android Studio / iOS equivalents to apply custom skins (WhatsApp+ style).

Community Marketplace: Open repo for sharing themes, character profiles, and extensions.

5. Philosophy

GPTsonaUI is not about monetization — it’s about user agency and immersion.
Where big AI companies control UI/UX tightly, this project gives freedom back to the user.

This is intended as an open-source seed project:

Free to use.

Free to remix.

Free to expand.

If you’re reading this and see the potential, build it.

6. Attribution

This project was directed and refined with the assistance of ChatGPT.
The vision, roadmap, and execution stem from collaborative iteration between a human originator and AI refinement.

No company affiliation. Pure community initiative.
